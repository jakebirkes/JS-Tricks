# Functions

## `fibSeq()`

Fibonacci Sequence limited by length using `fibSeq(length)`.

### Example:

```js
fibSeq(6); // only taking the first 6

> [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

## `sumArr`, `subArr`, & `multArr`

To find the sum-total of sub-total of an array, as well as multiplying all items of array and finding the average. We do this by making use of `.reduce()` and the arrow `=>` function. You'll see it's the same basic line with different operators each corresponding to the variable name.

### `sumArr`

```js
var sumArr = (acc, cur) => acc + cur;
```

``` js
let exArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

exArray.reduce(sumArr);
> 21 // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6

let exArraytwo = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]];
exArrayTwo[2].reduce(sumArr);
> 9 // 4 + 5
```

### `subArr`

```js
var subArr = (acc, cur) => acc - cur;
```

``` js
let exArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];

exArray.reduce(subArr);
> -8 // 1 - 2 ...
```

### `multArr`

```js
var multArr = (acc, cur) => acc * cur;
```

``` js
let exArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

exArr.reduce(multArr);

> 720
```

### Find the average easily with `multArr`

~~Get the average of an array using `avgArr()`.~~

**There is a much simpler way of finding the average of an array. Just use `multArr` as mentioned above and divide by `.length`:**

```js
let exArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

exArr.reduce(sumArr) / exArr.length;

> 3.5
```

## `partition()`

You can nest arrays in one by any size you need using `partition(arr, length)`.

```js

let thisArray = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];

partition(thisArray, 2); // grouping them in pairs

> [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7]]
```

## `flatArr`

If you need to "flatten" these nested arrays back into one array. Use the following:

```js
var flatArr = (acc, it) => [...acc, ...it];
```

```js
let thisArray = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7]];

thisArray.reduce(flatArr);

> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

### `.flat()`

*A potentially better alternative!*

This is something new to me that is similar to `.reduce(flatArr)` except you can go by a specified depth.

You can find more details on this on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat)

```js
// thisArray = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7]];

thisArray.flat(); // default depth = 1

> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

## `digRoot`

Find the digital root of a non-negative integer by using `digRoot(num)`. The process continues until a single-digit number is reached.

```js
let val = 6765;
digRoot(val);

> 6
```

## `highlight()`

`highlight(msg)` or `highlight(msg, clr)`

This will highlight with neon green in the console. Or if you want a different color, simply add a rgb or hex value.

## `stripDuplicateId()`

*Written in jQuery*

If the document has an issue where there are more than one of the same id, but the elements do not need to be removed, simply call this function. Any duplicate id that does exist, its name will be stored in an array called `window.removedIDs`.

```js
stripDuplicateId();
> "stripDuplicateId() stripped the following duplicate ids:",
    ["#fetured-section","#productCard"] // fake examples...
```

## `killDuplicateContent()`

`killDuplicateContent(arr)`

*Written in jQuery*

This will check if the text contained are repeated in the same elements and will remove all except for the first element. This takes an array of strings. A safe way to retain elements with unique content even if targeted using the same class name or attribute. Any duplicate content that does exist, the target name will be stored in an array called `window.removedContent`.

```js
let arr = [
    'div.description',
    'span.product-price',
    'p.specifications'
    ];

killDuplicateContent(arr);
> "killDuplicateContent() removed the following duplicate elements:",
    ["div.description", "span.product-price", "p.specifications"]
```

## `killDuplicates()`

`killDuplicates(arr)`

*Written in jQuery*

For obvious duplicates that need to be removed. This will remove all except for the first element. Uses an array of strings like `killDuplicateText(arr)`. The difference being it will remove elements without checking anything first. Any duplicates that does exist, the target name will be stored in an array called `window.removedDuplicates`.

```js
let arr = [
    'h1',
    'form.subcribe',
    'nav'
    ];

killDuplicates(arr);

> "killDuplicates() removed the following duplicate elements:",
    ["h1", "form.subcribe", "nav"]
```

## `lzySrc()`

`lzySrc(selector, dataWidth)`

Solution for blocking Shopify's lazyload.js to manually set a valid `src` attribute by replacing `{width}` in `data-src` with a chosen value from `data-widths` string perceived as an array.

#### Before

Check to see what is available in the `data-widths` attribute.

``` js
document.querySelectorAll('img.lazyload')[0].getAttribute('data-widths')
> "[360, 540, 720, 900, 1080, 1296, 1512, 1728, 1944, 2048]" // array as a string

document.querySelectorAll('img.lazyload')[0].src
> "http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2345/6789/files/example_img_300x300.jpg?v=1553094531"
```

#### After

Target all `img` tags with the `lazyload` class and select a width from the array.

```js
lzySrc('img.lazyload', 3); // 3 = fourth from data-widths: 900

document.querySelectorAll('img.lazyload')[0].src
> "http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2345/6789/files/example_img_900x.jpg?v=1553094531"
```

## `storeEndpoint()`

Using `storeEndpoint(url, name)` to request the endpoint and storing it with a unique name given along with the url. It requires the endpoint url, and the variable name you wish to give it.

This also stored the endpoint url as `nameEndpoint.src_url` so you can quickly associate where this endpoint was fetched from. This stored url remains outside of the fetched endpoint as well.

*In the function, you will see this stored in the `window`. If you would like to have all data bundled together as one object, I would recommend adding in something like `window.siteData`.*

```js
storeEndpoint(location.origin + location.pathname + '.json', 'product');

productEndpoint
> {...}

productEndpoint.src_url
> "https://www.example.com/products/exampleproduct.json"
```

## `regexStoreEndpoint()`

`regexStoreEndpoint(url, name, regex)` is more situational and works much like `storeEndpoint` but will only fetch an endpoint if the page URL depending on a regex match. This is so it's not waiting on a promise that is expected to fail.

```js
regexStoreEndpoint(location.origin + location.pathname + '.json', 'inventory', /necklace/);

// Example: location.href ~ www.example.com/collections/necklaces
> "regexStoreEndpoint(): url successfully matched /necklace/ & fetched inventoryEndpoint"

// Example: location.href ~ www.example.com/collections/watches
> "regexStoreEndpoint(): url did not match /necklace/"

// No errors were made :)
```

## `ampCSSBudget()`

***[AMPâš¡](https://amp.dev/)***

Because AMP restricts pages to a [50k CSS Budget](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/style_and_layout/?format=websites#add-styles-to-a-page) you can check in the console how close you are in reaching this limit by evaluating the number of characters used in `style[amp-custom]`. Depending on how much is used, it will highlight in green (<= 50%), yellow (<= 75%), or red (> 75%).
