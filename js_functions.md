# Functions

## fibSeq()

Fibonacci Sequence limited by length using `fibSeq()`. 

### Example:

```js
fibSeq(24); // only taking the first 24
```

### Result

```js
(24)Â [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368]

```

## sumArray()

Get the total sum of an array using `sumArray()`

### Example

``` js
let exArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

sumArray(exArr);
```

### Result

```js
21
```

## multArray()

Multiply an array using `multArray()`

### Example

``` js

let exArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

multArray(exArr);
```

### Result

```js
720
```

## avgArray()

Get the average of an array using `avgArray()`.

### Example

``` js
let exArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

avgArray(exArr);
```

### Result

```js
3.5
```

## groupArray()

You can regroup an array into sub-arrays using `groupArray(array, groupSize)`

### Example

```js

let thisArray = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];

groupArray(thisArray, 2); //grouping them in pairs

```

### Result

```js
(4) [Array(2), Array(2), Array(2), Array(2)]
    0: (2) [0, 1]
    1: (2) [2, 3]
    2: (2) [4, 5]
    3: (2) [6, 7]
    length: 4
    __proto__: Array(0)"
```

## digitalRoot()

Find the digital root of a non-negative integer by using `digitalRoot()`. The process continues until a single-digit number is reached.

### Huh?

For example, let's take the number 6765. If a number is greater than or equal to 10, we split the number by its digits and add them together. We will continue this process until it's less than 10:

Is 6765 greater than or equal to 10?

Yes, split then add!
[6, 7, 6, 5], 6 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 24

Is 24 greater than or equal to 10?

Yes, split then add!
[2, 4], 2 + 4 = 6

Is 6 greater than or equal to 10?

No!
Therefore, 6 is the Digital Root of 6765!

### Example

```js
let val = 6765;

digitalRoot(val);
```

### Result

```js
6
```

## lazySrc()

Solution for Shopify's lazyload.js will create a new `src` attribute by replacing '{width}' in `data-src` with a chosen value from `data-widths` array using `lazySrc([obj], [num])`.

*Currently written in jQuery*

### Example

``` js
let target = $(`<img
                class="lazyload"
                data-src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/path/to/example-{width}px.jpg"
                data-widths="[540, 720, 900, 1080, 1296, 1512, 1728, 1944, 2048, 4472]">
            `);

lazySrc(target, 3); // 3 = 1080

console.log(target.attr('src'));
```

### Result

```js
"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/path/to/example-1080px.jpg"
```

### fetchEndpoint() & fetchMalformedEndpoint()

Using `fetchEndpoint(endpoint, name)` to request the enpoint and storing it with a unique name given along with the url. It requires the endpoint url, and the variable name you wish to give it. Dealing with Shopify's REST API, fetching JSON isn't always succesful due to how a particular JSON endpoint is structured ~ give `fetchMalformedEndpoint(endpoint, name)` a try if the first one fails.

This also stored the endpoint url as nameEndpoint.src_url so you can quickly associate where this enpoint was taken from.

### Example

```js
fetchEndpoint(location.origin + location.pathname + '.json', 'product');
fetchMalformedEndpoint(location.origin + location.pathname + '.js', 'collection');

productEndpoint
> {...}

productEndpoint.src_url
> "https://www.example.com/products/exampleproduct.json"

collectionEndpoint
> {...}

collectionEndpoint.src_url
> "https://www.example.com/collection/example-products.js"
```

### regexFetchEndpoint()

`regexFetchEndpoint(endpoint, name, regex)` is more situational and works much like `fetchEndpoint()` and `fetchMalformedEndpoint()` but will only fetch an endpoint if the page URL depending on a regex match. This is so it's not waiting on a promise that is expected to fail.

```js
regexFetchEndpoint(location.origin + location.pathname + '.json', 'inventory', /necklace/);

// Example: location.href ~ www.example.com/collections/necklaces
> fetched inventoryEndpoint

// Example: location.href ~ www.example.com/collections/watches
> did not fetch inventoryEndpoint

// No errors were made :)
```
